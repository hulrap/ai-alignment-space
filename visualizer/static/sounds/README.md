# Audio Files for AI Alignment Visualization

This directory contains audio files used for interaction feedback in the visualization.

## Required Files

Place your audio files in this directory with the following names:

- `hover.mp3` - Sound played when hovering over nodes
- `click.mp3` - Sound played when clicking on nodes
- `background.mp3` - Background music that loops continuously

## Supported Formats

The system supports all audio formats that browsers can play:
- **MP3** (recommended for best compatibility)
- **WAV** (uncompressed, larger files)
- **OGG** (good compression, not supported in Safari)
- **M4A/AAC** (good compression, widely supported)

## Configuration

Audio settings can be configured in `visualizer/config.py`:

```python
AUDIO_CONFIG = {
    # Sound files for interaction feedback
    'hover_sound': '/static/sounds/hover.mp3',      # Path to hover sound
    'click_sound': '/static/sounds/click.mp3',      # Path to click sound
    'background_sound': '/static/sounds/background.mp3',  # Background music (loops continuously)
    
    # Audio settings
    'volume': 1.0,                                  # Master volume (0.0 to 1.0)
    'background_volume': 1.0,                       # Background music volume (usually lower)
    'enabled_by_default': True,                     # Whether sound is enabled on page load
    
    # Individual sound control
    'hover_sounds_enabled': True,                   # Enable/disable hover sounds globally
    'click_sounds_enabled': True,                   # Enable/disable click sounds globally
    'background_music_enabled': True,               # Enable/disable background music globally
    
    # Fallback to generated sounds if files don't exist
    'fallback_to_generated': True,                  # Use Web Audio API if files fail to load
}
```

## Fallback Behavior

If audio files are not found or fail to load:
1. The system will automatically fall back to procedurally generated sounds (hover/click only)
2. A console warning will be logged
3. Users can still toggle sound on/off normally
4. Background music has no fallback - it simply won't play if the file is missing

## Background Music Behavior

- **Autoplay**: Starts automatically on first user interaction (due to browser restrictions)
- **Looping**: Continuously loops until manually stopped
- **Volume**: Set independently from interaction sounds (usually lower)
- **Control**: Controlled by the same sound toggle button (ðŸ”Š/ðŸ”‡) as other sounds
- **Compatibility**: Works alongside hover and click sounds without interference

## Individual Sound Control

You can now disable specific types of sounds globally through configuration:

### Disable Hover Sounds
```python
'hover_sounds_enabled': False,  # Completely disables all hover sounds
```

### Disable Click Sounds
```python
'click_sounds_enabled': False,  # Completely disables all click sounds
```

### Disable Background Music
```python
'background_music_enabled': False,  # Completely disables background music
```

### Benefits of Individual Control
- **Performance**: Skip loading audio files for disabled sound types
- **Customization**: Create different audio experiences (e.g., music-only, effects-only)
- **Accessibility**: Allow users to disable specific sound types that might be distracting
- **Development**: Easily test different audio combinations

## Recommendations

### Hover Sound
- **Duration**: 0.1-0.3 seconds
- **Style**: Short, crisp, sci-fi targeting sound
- **Examples**: Blaster shot, electronic beep, targeting lock

### Click Sound
- **Duration**: 0.5-3.0 seconds
- **Style**: Dramatic, impactful confirmation sound
- **Examples**: Planetary whoosh, deep impact, cinematic boom

### Background Music
- **Duration**: Any length (will loop automatically)
- **Style**: Ambient, atmospheric, non-intrusive
- **Examples**: Space ambient, cinematic score, electronic atmosphere
- **Volume**: Automatically set lower than interaction sounds

### Technical Tips
- Keep file sizes reasonable (< 1MB each)
- Use consistent volume levels between files
- Test in different browsers for compatibility
- Consider using MP3 for best browser support

## Example File Structure

```
visualizer/static/sounds/
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ hover.mp3          # Your hover sound file
â”œâ”€â”€ click.mp3          # Your click sound file
â””â”€â”€ background.mp3     # Your background music file
```

## Testing

1. Place your audio files in this directory
2. Restart the application
3. Check browser console for loading messages
4. Test hover and click interactions
5. Use the sound toggle button (ðŸ”Š/ðŸ”‡) to verify functionality
